Last Friday i didn't attend the the lab sessions
i had to listen to the recordings and do the labs
Athough very long but very interesting.
Thank you Theo and the entire Wirfon-lab family for 
your time and dedication. 
Quite undstanding yvonne, you are motivation .
I noticed your file "yvonne" does not have the .md extension ggood to know that github accepts it!
