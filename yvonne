Last Friday i didn't attend the the lab sessions
i had to listen to the recordings and do the labs
Athough very long but very interesting.
Thank you Theo and the entire Wirfon-lab family for 
your time and dedication. 
Quite undstanding yvonne
I noticed your file "yvonne" does not have the .md extension. Just curious to know whether it is ok or not!
