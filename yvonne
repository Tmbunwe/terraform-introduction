Last Friday i didn't attend the the lab sessions
i had to listen to the recordings and do the labs
Athough very long but very interesting.
Thank you Theo and the entire Wirfon-lab family for 
your time and dedication. 
Quite undsatanding yvonne
I noticed your file "yvonne" does not have the .md extension.  Just curious to know wether it is ok as well!
